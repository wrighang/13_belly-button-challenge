## Background
In this assignment, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Requirements

### Bar Chart
- Chart initializes without error  
- Chart updates when a new sample is selected  
- Chart uses Top 10 sample values as values  
- Chart uses otu_ids as the labels  
- Chart uses otu_labels as the tooltip  

### Bubble Charts
- Chart initializes without error  
- Chart updates when a new sample is selected  
- Chart uses otu_ids for the x values  
- Chart uses otu_ids for marker colors  
- Chart uses sample_values for the y values  
- Chart uses sample_values for the marker size  
- Chart uses otu_labels for text values  

### Metadata and Deployment
- Metadata initializes without error  
- Metadata updates when a new sample is selected  
- App Successfully Deployed to Github Pages  

====================================================================
## CODING_PROCESS

- I frequently referred to the activities throughout the challenge to ensure I was on track.
- For the Bar Chart, I used Xpert Learning Assistant to help with mapping the otu_ids to a list of strings to serve as yticks for better labeling and readability.
- I wanted to add spacing between the bar and bubble chart and looked up how to do it and modifyed the .html file
- Purchased and referenced "Data Visualization with Python and JavaScript" and "Data Visualization with D3 Cookbook". These books provided valuable insights and alternative approaches to tackle the activity.
